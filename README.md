## Executive Summary
The Holographic Entropic Receipt Theory (HERT) describes reality as an interplay between information coherence and entropic discharge.  
This repository synthesizes empirical evidence from the **Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)** data and formalizes the theory through **toroidal geometric modeling**.

Key findings indicate that the CMBâ€™s acoustic peaks exhibit high signal-to-noise ratios (7â€“9Ïƒ for temperature and 9â€“12Ïƒ for polarization), interpreted as *holographic receipts*â€”stable entropic memory imprints formed during the universeâ€™s initial coherence collapse.

The **toroidal model** represents the holographic feedback loop of energy-information flow, quantifying processes such as coherence collapse and the emission of *loosh* (energy released during entropy conversion). The framework scales from subatomic to cosmic systems.
